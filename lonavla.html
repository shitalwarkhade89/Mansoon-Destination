<p style="font-size: 30px;"><b></b>Lonavala is a hill station surrounded by green valleys in western India near Mumbai.<br/>
     The Karla Caves and the Bhaja Caves are ancient Buddhist shrines carved out of the rock.<br/>
      They feature massive pillars and intricate relief sculptures. South of the Bhaja <br/>
      Caves sits the imposing Lohagad Fort, with its 4 gates. West of here is Bhushi Dam, where water<br/>
       overflows onto a set of steps during rainy season.</b></p><hr>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; History Of Lonavala:-<img src="history-book (1).png" height="40"/>
       </h2></u>
       <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Present day Lonavala was a part of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty. 
        Later, the Mughals realised the strategic importance of the region and kept the region for
         an extended time. The forts in the region and the "Mavala" warriors played an important role in the
          history of the Maratha Empire and that of the Peshwas. In 1871, the Lonavala and Khandala hill stations 
          were discovered by Lord Elphinstone, who was the Governor of Bombay Presidency at the time.

       <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lonavala and the adjacent Khandala are twin hill stations 622 metres (2,041 ft) above sea level,<br>
         in the Sahyadri ranges that demarcate the Deccan Plateau and the Konkan coast. The hill stations
          sprawl over an approximate area of 38 square kilometres (15 sq mi). Tourism peaks during the monsoon season.
           The name Lonavala is derived from the words 'leni' which means caves and 'avali' which means series. i.e.
            'a series of Caves' which is a reference to the many caves like Karla Caves, Bhaja Caves and Bedsa that
             are close to Lonavala. A trip to Lonavala and Khandala can be combined with sight-seeing visits of Karla,
              Bhaja and Bedsa caves and also the two fortresses, Lohagad and Visapur. Another place of interest is the 
              Tungi fort, one of the forts captured by Malik Ahmad near the village of Karjat and was known for its natural 
              strength.[4] The Andharban trek begins from village Pimpri, passes through dense forests, valleys and waterfalls 
              and ends in Bhira.
