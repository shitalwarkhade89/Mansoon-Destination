    <p><b>Sinhagad is an ancient hill fortress located at around 49 km southwest of the city of Pune, India.

        Previously known as Kondhana, the fort had been the site of many battles,
         most notably the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670.</b></p>
         <p><b>It is Located near the Pune district in Maharashtra. The fort is also on the
             famous fort in Maharashtra which has a great history of Tanaji Malusare.
              The fort was captured by Tanaji Malusare and his brother. Sinhagad (Lion's Fort)
               fort was strategically built to provide natural protection from the enemies due
                to its very steep slopes. The walls of the forts and bastions were constructed 
                only at key places. There are two gates to enter the fort named Kalyan Darwaja and Pune Darwaza. 
                The Kalyan Darwaja is towards the southeast while the Pune Darwaza is towards north east.</b></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; History Of Sinhagad:-<img src="history-book (1).png" height="45"/>
   </h2></u>
   <p style="font-size: 25px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Sinhagad Fort was initially known as "Kondhana" after the sage 
    Kaundinya. The Kaundinyeshwar temple coupled with the caves and carvings indicates that the 
    fort had probably been built around two thousand years ago.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The fort was captured by forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1328 from Koli chieftain Nag Naik 
    after a siege of eight months.[5][6] It then became part of the Bahmani sultanate followed by the 
    Nizam Shahi of Ahmadnagar in 1485.After the fall of Nizam shahi it came under the control of the
     Adilshahi in early late 1500s.

   <p style="font-size: 25px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of the once extensive fortification are in ruins.
     The fort houses a memorial to Tanaji as well as the tomb of Rajaram I. Visitors can see 
     the military stables, a brewery and a temple of the goddess Kali (goddess) along with 
     a Hanuman statue to the right side of the temple, as well as the historic gates. 
     The original commemorative memorial of Tanaji Malusare has been unearthed by the 
     restoration workers at Sinhagad Fort in Feb 2019. The stone structure was found buried 
     under cement, concrete, and layers of oil paint and is believed to be around 350 years old.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;By bus â€“ Plenty of buses run to Sinhagad Fort from Pune. 
          You can take a state-run or private Sinhagad Fort bus from the Swargate bus stand.
           They drop you at Donaje village, the base of the Sinhagad Fort. From there, you can trek 
           your way up to the top of the fort.

              <p style="font-size: 25px;">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Pune railway station is the nearest railhead to reach the fort. 
                Once you get down to the railway station, walk to the bus depo and take the PMT bus
                to the base of the fort. I would suggest you reach Swargate from Pune station which 
                is at a distance of 15 min by bus and then take a bus to the base of the fort.
